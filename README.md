## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure you have the trained model file:**
   - Place the `plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt` file in the project root directory.

5. **Set up the database files:**
   - Place `disease_info.csv` and `supplement_info.csv` in the project root directory.

## 📦 Dependencies

The main dependencies for this project are:

- Flask
- Torch
- Torchvision
- Pillow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Ollama

For a complete list, refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask development server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open a web browser and navigate to:** `http://localhost:5000`

## 🤖 AI Chatbot Implementation

The AI chatbot uses the Ollama library for natural language processing. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

```python
import ollama

# Chatbot system prompt
system_prompt = """
You are an AI assistant specializing in plant diseases and health...
"""

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    data = request.json
    message = data['message']
    disease_context = data.get('disease_context', '')
    
    conversation = [
        {'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt},
        {'role': 'user', 'content': f"Disease Context: {disease_context}\n\nUser Question: {message}"}
    ]
    
    def generate():
        for chunk in ollama.chat(model='dolphin-llama3', messages=conversation, stream=True):
            yield chunk['message']['content']
    
    return Response(stream_with_context(generate()), content_type='text/plain')
```

Ensure you have Ollama set up and running on your system for the chatbot to function properly.

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Modify `app.py`** to adjust Flask configurations or AI model parameters.
- **Update `disease_info.csv` and `supplement_info.csv`** to modify disease information and supplement recommendations.

## 📱 Mobile Support

The application is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Train the model on your local machine and place the `plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt` file in the project root before running the application.
- For deployment, consider using a production-ready web server like Gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx.
- Ensure all static files and uploads are properly served in a production environment.
